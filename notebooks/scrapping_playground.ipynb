In its recent response to the remedies brief, the SEC challenged Ripple’s insistence that the blockchain startup acted without recklessness and that there should be no “widespread uncertainty” about the legal status of XRP  XRP  $0.52  despite the court previously rejecting this “fair notice” defense.  XRP   $0.52  The SEC also maintains its stance on whether Ripple will likely engage in similar actions in the future, even though Ripple has not violated any rules since the XRP lawsuit was initiated in 2020.  According to the remedies brief, Ripple has tried to downplay its liability while highlighting its cooperation with the SEC since the 2013 XRP initial coin offering. However, the SEC emphasized that, according to the law, even if Ripple had refrained from violations since 2020, another breach is still possible. The SEC argues that Ripple’s assurances about changing its behavior post-lawsuit do not justify avoiding injunctions. According to the SEC, Ripple’s claims of following legal guidance and restructuring future XRP sales based on the lawsuit’s order are misleading. The SEC contends that Ripple misinterprets the order and fails to accept its implications for compliance.  The reply refutes Ripple’s assertions about conducting sales outside the U.S. and to accredited investors, as these defenses were abandoned during summary judgment.  Additionally, Ripple’s claims of contract changes for on-demand liquidity sales are dismissed, as these contracts already lacked certain restrictions identified as violations.  Related: Did XRP price just bottom against Bitcoin?  Ultimately, the SEC argues that Ripple’s assertions do not negate the need for injunctions to prevent future violations. Responding to the SEC’s reply in the remedies brief, Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, commented that the SEC’s reputation continues to decline.  He highlighted that international financial regulators with robust crypto licensing frameworks might be surprised that the SEC regard its efforts as akin to issuing fishing licenses. Alderoty criticized the SEC for not consistently applying the law. He expressed optimism about resolving the XRP lawsuit. While the crypto community eagerly awaits the case’s outcome, analysts anticipate a final judgment around September.

Ether  ETH  $3,003  is hovering close to a key support level at $3,010, having dropped by 1.85% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.   ETH   $3,003  However, liquidation maps show traders have more conviction that the price is going down in the near term — with $345 million in short positions set to liquidate if the price goes up by 3%.  On the other hand, a 3% drop to $2,920 would only wipe $237 million in long positions. It comes after Grayscale’s May 7 decision to withdraw its Ether futures ETF application, just three weeks before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was set to decide on it. It also comes amid speculation on whether Ether could be classified as a security and the fate of spot Ether ETF applications later in May.  Despite optimism earlier in the year, analysts are becoming increasingly doubtful about the chances of the SEC approving a spot Ether ETF as the next May 23 deadline approaches. The sentiment among the crypto community is similar. According to the New York-based crypto predictions platform Polymarket, 92% of participants believe the spot Ether ETFs will be denied. There are also broader concerns over Ethereum’s overall usage and lack of speculative interest from short-term holders (STH). “Usage of Ethereum is currently so low, that their burn mechanism is not keeping up with issuance to validators,” crypto on-chain analyst James Check, aka “Checkmatey,” said in a May 7 post on X.

Established in 2017, FutureMoney Group is an Asia-based venture capital (VC) focusing on the DePIN industry and artificial intelligence (AI) with an asset management scale of $50 million. The company covers alpha primary and secondary investment layouts of projects from different scales in\\xa0varying ecological niches. In this interview, FutureMoney Group co-founders Steven Li and Eo Hao draw an insightful image of the current DePIN landscape and how it can expand the Web3 space. Cointelegraph: How do you see the current state of the DePIN ecosystem? Steven Li: FutureMoney Group has been focusing on the DePIN area and has invested in many portfolios. We have tried our best to cover the different subdivisions of the DePIN sector so we have a more intuitive understanding of the development of the DePIN ecosystem.\\xa0 The DePIN ecosystem mainly has the following characteristics:\\xa0  BTC   $62,377  CT: FutureMoney Group is known as the first VC focusing on the DePIN field in Asia, closing a $20 million fund to invest in DePIN-related products and services. What has attracted the FutureMoney Group to the DePIN space? Eo Hao: The reason why we chose DePIN is that, on the one hand, we believe that after experiencing multiple rounds of bull markets, the overall market value of Web3 has expanded several times, and the Bitcoin ETF has been passed, the possibility and necessity of being connected to the real world has become imminent. DePIN is a good starting point and expression that combines the two worlds. On the other hand, because some of the LPs behind us include the largest hardware manufacturers in the Asian market, including electric vehicle manufacturing companies and mining farms listed in the United States, we pay special attention to the upstream and downstream related to blockchain and hardware.  EO is sharing DePIN opportunities on Web3 festival 2024. Source: FutureMoney Group CT: Could you share the story of the FutureMoney Group? When did you establish the company? SL: Co-founder Eo Hao and I started to invest in blockchain and encryption projects in 2016. In addition to buying BTC and Ether  ETH  $3,003 , we are also individual investors in BAT, Loopring, Qtum and other projects. After experiencing the ICO craze in 2017, we started investing in early crypto projects in early 2018 with a total of $1.5 million from our family, friends and our own savings.  ETH   $3,003   The two co-founders of FutureMoney Group are Eo Hao and Steven Li. Source: FutureMoney Group Although this amount cannot be counted as our official first fund, we started from a personal landmark event when an investor transformed into a company. CT: What was your initial goal when starting FutureMoney Group, and what are your goals now? SL: Because Eo and I both have financial technology backgrounds, our initial interest in blockchain technology also came from the belief that it would revolutionize the financial system. We established this fund to find the next generation of “money\" through investment, so the company Named FutureMoney. After several years of development and upgrading, we have developed from the initial venture capital business to a holding company in the crypto field covering asset management, mining, fund of funds and incubators, so after 2021, we officially changed the company name to FutureMoney Group. We hope to continue supporting early-stage startups by delving deeper into the crypto field through our methods while opening the window for more Asian investors to allocate crypto assets. CT: Where does FutureMoney Group stand now? Could you detail your investment practices and portfolio? EH: Our current investment theme is the Future of Work. As mentioned, FMG is the most professional investment institution on the DePIN track. Messari has included us, and DePIN Buddy has listed us as one of the most professional investment institutions on the DePIN track. Together with Borderless, Multicoin is equally famous. Our expertise is reflected in the depth and breadth of our DePIN Portfolio layout. We have three products: CT: What are your most significant milestones so far? SL: We successfully launched the world’s first DePIN Index and were listed by Messari as a representative DePIN VC in Asia in their DePIN mapping. We cooperate with the IOTEX Foundation for the Depin Surf. We are also working with China Bridge Capital and well-known hardware equipment manufacturers that supply hardware to Apple and Tesla. CT: How do you see the future of the DePIN space? EH: If many hot spots such as BTC ecology, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Ethereum are the in-depth internal builds of the Web3 industry and seek deeper research, then DePIN, AI and RWA are helping Web3 expand its breadth. Both have huge market potential, and the Bitcoin ecosystem is also a trillion-dollar market. But, in the real world, we strongly believe that DePIN will have huge development potential and wealth space. Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

According to a class action settlement filed on May 3, retired NFL star Rob “Gronk” Gronkowski will pay the largest share of $1.9 million. NBA player Victor Oladipo will pay $500,000 and NASCAR driver Landon Cassill will pay $25,000. All three sports stars have agreed to the settlements without admitting to or denying any of the accusations. The proposed settlement includes all U.S. individuals who enrolled in a Voyager Earn Program Account or purchased VGX tokens from October 2019 to the preliminary approval date. In addition to approving the $2.4 million settlement, plaintiffs also plan to ask for an award of attorney fees of roughly $792,000. Gronkowski, who launched an NFT collection in 2021, became a Voyager partner, “brand ambassador,” shareholder, and VGX tokenholder in September 2021, according to a press release at the time. Investor’s legal representative Adam Moskowitz said the settlements are largely due to the athletes, “who really wanted to help their fans.” “Gronk had a sincere empathy for all of his fans, even though he lost money with Voyager as well. It is no surprise he continues to be such a trusted and respected spokesperson,” he told Law360. A group of investors filed the class action against Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban in 2022, adding Gronkowski and other Voyager promoters in 2023.  The settlements were negotiated through mediation aiming to resolve two key issues — whether the Voyager products were unregistered securities and whether the promoters solicited investors.

      "\n",
      "💥 In a shocking twist, Tigran Gambaryan, a high-ranking executive from the renowned cryptocurrency exchange Binance, dramatically collapsed during his money laundering trial in Nigeria on May 23. The courtroom was left in awe as the unfolding events took an unexpected turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "📌 The incident occurred at the Federal High Court in Abuja, just moments after Justice Emeka Nwite called for the continuation of the case. Gambaryan's health took a sudden downturn, leaving everyone concerned about his well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ Gambaryan, an American citizen, and his co-defendant Nadeem Anjarwalla are facing serious charges of laundering a staggering sum of over $35 million. However, both executives have maintained their innocence throughout the proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "🟠 As the trial resumed, Gambaryan's absence from the dock raised eyebrows. With the help of his lawyer, he was eventually seated in the front row after collapsing en route. His legal representative promptly informed the court about his client's deteriorating health and submitted a written application to address this concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ \"My lord, it is evident that today's proceedings cannot proceed,\" stated Mordi, Gambaryan's lawyer, emphasizing his client's indisposition and urgent need for medical attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚡️ A letter presented to Judge Nwite shed light on Gambaryan's worsening condition. It revealed that he had recently suffered from malaria and received intravenous treatment just a day prior. This setback had also caused him to miss another trial related to tax evasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "‼️ Considering the gravity of the situation, Judge Nwite made a compassionate ruling: Gambaryan must receive proper medical care either at a hospital recommended by his lawyer or one designated by prison authorities. Consequently, the trial has been adjourned until June 20 and 21 to accommodate his treatment.\n",

      "\n",
      "📌 In a bid to foster a healthier crypto ecosystem, Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is calling on small and medium-sized projects to address the concerning trend of low float and high fully diluted valuations (FDV).\n",
      "\n",
      "💪 Binance is committed to supporting projects with strong fundamentals, an organic community base, and a sustainable business model. The goal? To act as responsible industry participants and enhance blockchain development.\n",
      "\n",
      "📢 This call to action comes as new projects with high market caps lock away a significant portion of their token supply, leading to limited liquidity at launch. While this can cause rapid price appreciation, it often proves unsustainable when tokens flood the market later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔓 Token unlocking is set to continue, with an estimated $3 billion worth of vested tokens scheduled for release in May 2024 alone. Binance predicts that between 2024 and 2030, around $155 billion in tokens will be unlocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "⬇️ Pseudonymous researcher Flow highlights that 80% of tokens listed on Binance have declined since their launch in the past six months. These tokens are seen by some as \"exit liquidity\" for insiders taking advantage of restricted retail access.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ However, not all hope is lost. Tokens like Ordi have seen impressive gains, up over 261% since launch. Meanwhile, memecoins like Dogwifhat have also surged, driven by retail interest and their long-term holding potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌐 It's not just about memecoins though; concerns persist about the high initial FDVs of new tokens listed on Binance, averaging over $4.2 billion. Building a substantial user base remains crucial for these projects' success.\n",

      "📌 Hong Kong has taken a groundbreaking step by becoming the first region outside mainland China to launch digital wallets for holding China's CBDC e-CNY. This move, announced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), allows both residents and expats to conveniently open e-CNY wallets using their local mobile numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ The four major mainland Chinese state-owned banks authorized for this service are the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Construction Bank, and the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China.\n",
      "\n",
      "💼 Unlike regular digital wallets, the e-CNY wallet carries the weight of being fully endorsed by the People's Bank of China, as emphasized by Howard Lee, Deputy Chief Executive of HKMA.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌐 The primary aim of introducing the digital yuan in Hong Kong is to offer a \"safe and convenient option\" for cross-border payments within the Greater Bay Area integration zone, which encompasses Hong Kong, Macao, and nine cities in Guangdong province.\n",
      "\n",
      "🛍 While this development marks a significant stride towards yuan internationalization, retailers in Hong Kong express concerns about potential diversion of consumption to mainland cities like Shenzhen, where mobile payments are more prevalent.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 Presently, around 300 merchants in Hong Kong accept e-CNY payments, subject to certain limits: individual wallet balances capped at ¥10,000 ($1,380), single transactions limited to ¥2,000, and annual spending restricted to ¥50,000.\n",

      "⚡️ Topping up these wallets is made seamless through integration with Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS).\n",

      "\n",
      "🚩 SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce is not holding back, calling out her own agency and its controversial SAB 121 during a recent speech. She believes the agency's actions are not only puzzling but also \"scaring people off\" from the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ Peirce paints a vivid picture, comparing the SEC to a secret garden with confusing rules. She points out that while these \"diktats\" aren't final, compliance is a must to avoid any trouble with the SEC.\n",
      "\n",
      " ‼️But it's SAB 121 that really gets under her skin. She likens it to an unwanted \"weed\" in the garden, arguing that it hampers innovation and keeps experienced players out of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ The SEC's creation of SAB 121 might even be considered regulatory overreach, according to Peirce. She highlights that the Government Accountability Office thinks it should have been submitted to Congress for review.\n",
      "\n",
      "💼 To make matters worse, there's a lack of clarity. The framework for applying SAB 121 to broker-dealers was only shared orally at a conference, leaving many confused about its binding nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "👌 It's not just about crypto custody; Peirce suggests that these heavy-handed regulations are having a chilling effect on the industry as a whole, \"scaring people off\" from engaging in discussions about regulation.\n",

      "🔍 These remarks from Commissioner Peirce shed light on growing dissatisfaction within the SEC itself. As the crypto world faces increased scrutiny, it remains to be seen how this internal criticism will shape future policies.\n",

      "\n",
      "♾ The metaverse can be wielded as a crucial tool in the hands of law enforcement agencies for training, crime prevention, and forensic analysis according to a new document released by Interpol. The report by the international organization seeks to delve into the possibilities of the metaverse, harnessing the digital world to solve real-world problems around security and law enforcement. \n",
      "\n",
      "🟢 Interpol looks toward deploying the metaverse as a tool to usher in the future of crime prevention through several methods that involve the digitization of the process. According to the report, virtual worlds will be used to create replicas of real-life crime scenes to aid authorities study and improving their analysis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ A major benefit of this is the preservation even after the actual crime scene has been altered leading to better investigation as no stone will be left unturned and all possible angles monitored. Future integration of the metaverse into the legal systems in certain jurisdictions would enable judicial officers to visit sites virtually as in the case where they visit physically.\n",
      "\n",
      "📌 Technologies associated with the metaverse like Extended Reality (XR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR) tools will enhance how authorities deal with complex cases and offer new perspectives. A notable recommendation by Interpol is the digitization of police stations and administrative processes which will see authorities report crimes and offer community support services virtually.\n",

      "📝 Japan's ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party, is calling for urgent reforms to the country's crypto tax system.\n",

      "After years of debate, the Russian government is finally turning its attention to Bitcoin mining. Andreу Lugovoy, the chairman of the crypto working group, revealed that discussions are now centered around this crucial aspect of the industry. While altcoins will follow suit, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing measures are expected to be imposed, potentially leading to a ban on privacy coins like Monero.\n",

      "\n",
      "🚨 In a surprising twist, CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham has taken aim at her own agency, criticizing its recent enforcement action against KuCoin. Pham warns that this move could potentially encroach on the SEC's jurisdiction and upset the delicate balance of investor protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "🛡 While Pham acknowledges the CFTC's duty to safeguard U.S. markets, she cautions against overstepping boundaries by treating a financial instrument like a derivative. According to her, it's crucial to differentiate between owning shares and trading derivatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "♾ The CFTC's charges against KuCoin are no small matter, alleging a slew of illicit activities such as off-exchange futures trading and inadequate KYC procedures. But this clash isn't just about one exchange; it's part of a larger tug-of-war between the CFTC and the SEC.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤝 The battle for regulatory supremacy in the crypto realm rages on, with the CFTC traditionally overseeing commodities and the SEC keeping an eye on securities. But as digital assets blur these lines, tensions mount, and agencies vie for control.\n",
      "\n",
      "💼 KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu may brush off these charges as par for the course in the industry, but with the DOJ also joining in with its own set of allegations, it's clear that regulators are taking a hard look at compliance in the crypto space.\n",

      "🔒 In a shocking turn of events, a South Korean civil servant has been apprehended for her involvement in crypto-related fraud and voice phishing attacks. This incident, which unfolded on March 27, has once again raised concerns about the security of digital assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 The accused, a level six district office official in her 50s, allegedly received money from multiple victims and cunningly converted it into Bitcoin (BTC). But that's not all – she reportedly didn't act alone, as the funds were then transferred to a member of a notorious voice phishing gang.\n",
      "\n",
      "🟢 The arrest took place at a bank in Seoul's Dongdaemun District, where the civil servant had apparently made an attempt to further her fraudulent activities. The scale of her misdeeds is staggering, with over $74,000 worth of ill-gotten gains finding their way into the crypto realm.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 As investigators dig deeper into this case, they are exploring whether the accused exploited her position to gain access to sensitive information that aided her criminal endeavors. The implications are alarming – if true, it would mean that even those entrusted with public service can become wolves in sheep's clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚠️ This incident is part of a larger trend of rising crypto crime in South Korea. Criminals often masquerade as trusted figures like civil servants or bank employees, preying on unsuspecting individuals by leveraging fears of cyberattacks or tax troubles.\n",

      "✔️ It's not the first time such an incident has rocked the nation. In 2023, another government worker made headlines by allegedly stealing millions from the National Health Insurance Corporation before fleeing to live a life of luxury abroad.

      "⚠️ Navigating Choppy Waters: The Perils of Shorting MSTR\n",
      "Back's main concern lies in the inherent riskiness of shorting MicroStrategy. Even if investors believe the company is overvalued, he warns that the ETF could still face significant challenges due to auto-rebalancing in a volatile market. As he puts it, \"you'll get rekt anyway.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "➡️ Binance dropped a bombshell on April 4, announcing the suspension of Bitcoin Ordinals trades and deposits starting April 18, 2024. Holders of these unique NFTs were urged to withdraw their assets from the platform's marketplace before May 18, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤔 The reason behind this move remains a mystery as Binance simply stated it was looking to \"streamline product offerings.\" Furthermore, the exchange's NFT marketplace will no longer offer perks related to Bitcoin NFTs after April 10, 2024.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "🚫 In a resolute move, the European Union (EU) has turned its attention to tackling sanctions violations, with a particular focus on the role of cryptocurrencies in evading restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "💼 MEPs Vote for Tougher Measures\n",
      "This Tuesday, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted overwhelmingly in favor of implementing stringent new laws. The aim? To crack down on offenses like arms embargoes, travel bans, and asset freezes, with a keen eye on the role of crypto-assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 Crypto Assets Under Scrutiny\n",

      "\n",
      "🔴 Russia’s biggest crypto mining industry association has hit out at Moscow’s plans to increase electricity tariffs for miners. The Ministry of Energy wants miners to fork out between two and five times more than they currently pay. As mining is not yet classified as a state-recognized form of “entrepreneurship,” most Russian miners currently pay the same kind of rates as residential homes. While power providers have been given the authority to raise miners’ hourly tariffs, the majority want Moscow to legalize the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ This would allow power companies to charge at higher unsubsidized industrial or commercial rates. But per Comnews, the Industrial Mining Association (APM) thinks that this will force miners into a “gray zone” of semi-illegality. The APM said that Russia is currently a “global leader” in the crypto mining sphere, but warned the nation would lose this advantage if the ministry’s plans are accepted. The head of Russia’s biggest mining firm this month claimed that mining in Russia was set to become far more profitable than in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "🟢 The ministry, however, thinks higher tariffs will discourage overzealous miners from setting up shop in some of Russia’s most remote regions. Energy chiefs last month said that the “depletion of energy capacity in certain regions of Russia” was becoming a problem. They think crypto miners are hindering the connection of “larger infrastructure and socially significant facilities” to power networks. In 2020, BitRiver miners claimed that one of their data centers was paying just RUB 1.11 (currently just over $0.01) per kilowatt for power.\n",

      "📌 In a plebiscite held on December 31, 2023, Moonwell sought community approval to use a combination of Nomad collateral and protocol reserves to address its Frax bad debt.

      "\n",
      "🌐 Bitcoin, once an enigma confined to the tech-savvy, is now flexing its muscles on the global stage. Former Bitmex CEO turned Maelstrom's CIO, Arthur Hayes, has his sights set on a jaw-dropping prediction: a $1 million price for the world's most famous cryptocurrency.\n",
      "\n",
      "🏦 It all hinges on the weak yen and its potential to send shockwaves through the financial system. Hayes believes that any move to address this delicate imbalance could spell trouble for the mighty US dollar, while simultaneously boosting Bitcoin to unprecedented heights.\n",
      "\n",
      "💱 In his latest newsletter, aptly titled \"The Easy Button,\" Hayes points to the USD-JPY exchange rate as the ultimate economic game-changer. Its current volatility, he argues, is like a ticking time bomb that will force the Federal Reserve's hand sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "🇨🇳 The ripple effects extend far beyond Japan, with China eyeing its neighbor's currency moves closely. A yen too feeble would tempt Beijing to devalue its own yuan, igniting a fierce battle for competitiveness and potentially pushing more manufacturing offshore.\n",
      "\n",
      "🏦 So what's the \"easy\" way out? According to Hayes, it's all about a little financial maneuvering: swapping freshly minted greenbacks for yen and letting Japan do its thing in foreign exchange markets. This could give China room to breathe by keeping its printing presses humming without rocking the economic boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 But there's a catch. Mishandling this delicate dance risks eroding the dollar's status as the world's go-to reserve currency. And that's where Bitcoin enters the picture – as a shining beacon of value amid fiat chaos. Institutional investors, Hayes suggests, would find it trivial to hop on the Bitcoin bandwagon via US-listed ETFs.\n",
      "\n",
      "📈 Hayes doesn't stop at lofty predictions; he's got a plan. When the yen situation is finally addressed, he'll be crunching numbers to estimate just how much fuel will be added to the Bitcoin fire.\n",

A pro-crypto stance could be a game-changer for politicians eyeing those swing Senate seats!\n",
      "\n",
      "📜 But it's not all moonshots and Lambos. The survey uncovers a deep-seated skepticism among voters about policymakers' grasp of the crypto cosmos.

      "\n",
      "🛑 The Chinese Embassy in Angola is sounding the alarm, advising its citizens and institutions to steer clear of crypto mining. This comes as Angola recently passed a law that makes such activities illegal. The embassy wants everyone to know that virtual currencies are not legal tender, so it's best to avoid any dealings with digital assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "⏰ Just days after Angola's crypto mining ban went into effect, the Chinese Embassy issued its warning on April 12. According to the new law, mining cryptocurrencies is now a criminal offense, carrying a hefty penalty of up to 12 years behind bars. Even just having mining equipment could land you up to five years in prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "🗣 Back in December 2023, Angola's lawmakers unanimously approved this crackdown on crypto mining. Otoniel Dos Santos, the Secretary of State for Finance and Treasury, argued that it was all about protecting Angola's monetary policy sovereignty and addressing concerns about the environmental impact and energy security.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌍 The Chinese Embassy echoes these concerns, pointing out the potential harm to both the environment and the financial system. They're not just blowing smoke either – there have already been cases of Chinese citizens facing legal consequences for their involvement in virtual mining and suspected electricity theft.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 But it's not just about mining – the embassy also wants its citizens to be on guard against get-rich-quick schemes masquerading as virtual currencies. They're urging caution when it comes to sharing personal information and using mobile devices securely.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "📈 The tide is turning for cryptocurrencies, as a recent survey by Deutsche Bank unveils a surge in optimism among consumers. With over 3,600 participants, the study conducted in March shows a remarkable shift in sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "👍 More than half of those surveyed (52%) now view digital currencies as an \"important asset class and payment method,\" signaling a growing acceptance of crypto's potential. This marks a significant jump from just a few months ago when less than 40% shared this belief.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌟 Bitcoin, the poster child of the crypto world, is also gaining favor. While some skeptics remain, only 38% expect it to fade away, while a confident 40% see it thriving in the years ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 Price predictions are getting bolder too. The number of respondents predicting bitcoin to dip below $20,000 by year-end is dwindling, with just one-third holding this view. On the flip side, 10% anticipate bitcoin reaching heights above $75,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "📈 What's driving this newfound enthusiasm? Analysts at Deutsche Bank point to several factors: the much-anticipated bitcoin halving, regulatory developments, central bank policies, and even hopes for Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n",
      "\n",
      "🚀 Market experts are echoing these sentiments. Coinbase expects buyers to pounce on bitcoin dips more aggressively this time around. Skybridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci sees untapped potential, emphasizing that the halving isn't fully priced in yet. LMAX's CEO envisions six-digit prices for bitcoin down the line, while Bitwise predicts a \"raging\" bull market post-halving.\n",

      "\n",
      "📉 As the countdown to the next Bitcoin block halving continues, miners are taking preemptive action. According to Cryptoquant, a leading crypto analytics firm, miners are offloading their BTC holdings in anticipation of reduced rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 While daily revenues may be soaring, there's a catch. The hashprice, a measure of mining profitability, has dropped by a staggering 30% since the last halving. This means miners are earning less for their computational efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "⛏ But it's not just dwindling profits that have miners worried. Transaction fees are also on the decline, adding to the challenges they face. With competition heating up, it's clear that innovation will be crucial for survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "📊 Cryptoquant's research paints a vivid picture: some miners have been selling off their bitcoin stash even before the halving, with daily sales hitting a high not seen since 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌪 Despite these headwinds, the overall revenue generated by the mining industry is at an all-time high. However, as we approach the halving event, it's becoming increasingly clear that miners need to find new ways to stay ahead in this ever-evolving landscape.\n",

      "\n",
      "🔒 In a groundbreaking move, Luxor and Bitnomial are teaming up to introduce exchange-traded hashrate futures specifically designed for institutional investors. This exciting development is set to launch on Bitnomial's derivatives trading platform by the end of March, providing miners with a powerful tool to hedge future income while giving investors a chance to explore hashrate futures on a trusted American exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 At the core of this innovative financial instrument is Luxor's Bitcoin Hashprice Index, which acts as a barometer for the value of 1 petahash per second (PH/s) of SHA256 hashpower. Think of it as the daily projected worth of 1 PH/s, neatly quantified in good old U.S. dollars. As of March 19, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, the hashprice per PH/s hovers just below $100, standing strong at $99.70.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚡️ However, it's important to remember that Bitcoin's hashprice can be as dynamic as a rollercoaster ride, with significant fluctuations over time. With the upcoming April 2024 Bitcoin Halving expected to add fuel to this volatility fire, Luxor's head of derivatives, Matt Williams, highlights the need for miners to manage their price risk effectively and ensure long-term sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "📈 Currently, Luxor's network data reveals that Bitcoin's hashrate is cruising at an impressive 600 exahash per second (EH/s), equivalent to a mind-boggling 600,000 petahash per second (PH/s) or a staggering 600,000,000 terahash per second (TH/s). As the partnership announcement unfolds, it becomes clear that these exciting hashrate futures will be accessible to individuals with a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) account, while Luxor gears up to facilitate connections with FCMs through its upcoming Introducing Broker (IB) initiative.\n",

      "🔒 Vanguard Stays the Course: Vanguard's CEO Tim Buckley, like his colleagues before him, is not budging on bitcoin. Despite the recent green light from the SEC for bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard customers won't find them in their portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔄 No Change in Sight: When asked about a potential shift in strategy, Buckley's response was crystal clear: \"We don't plan to.\" He emphasized that unless there's a significant shift in the nature of the asset class, bitcoin remains firmly in the realm of speculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 Cash Flows vs. Volatility: For Vanguard, it's all about tangible value. Stocks with their forward earnings make sense, but bitcoin? Not so much. Buckley dismissed it as an unreliable store of value, pointing to its rollercoaster ride of price swings and its correlation with market crises.\n",
      "\n",
      "⏳ The Countdown Begins: As Buckley prepares to pass the torch after three decades at Vanguard, his parting words on bitcoin echo his long-standing stance: it's a risky bet that doesn't belong in a long-term investment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a world where stability is sought after, Vanguard remains steadfast against the allure of digital gold.\n",

      "\n",
      "💹 The latest BLS inflation briefing has sent shockwaves through the financial markets, with a 3.2% rise in prices over the past year. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also saw a modest 0.4% increase. This mixed bag of data had Wall Street on edge, as some stocks surged while others stumbled.\n",
      "\n",
      "🏦 Earlier hopes of a rate cut have been dashed, according to experts at Barron's. Lara Rhame, chief U.S. economist at FS Investments, likened the situation to a game of Whac-A-Mole, where inflation keeps popping up unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "⚖️ The upcoming FOMC meeting takes on added significance in light of these figures. Preston Caldwell from Morningstar warns that the recent CPI report should give pause to those hoping for an imminent rate reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "📈 Not just stocks, but even the prices of gold and cryptocurrencies have been riding a rollercoaster lately. It seems investors are seeking safe havens amidst this uncertain economic climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 The CME Fed Watch tool now puts the odds of rates staying put at a staggering 99%, leaving just a slim 1% chance of a cut. This is quite a shift from just weeks ago when a rate reduction seemed more plausible.\n",

      "🚀 AI-Driven Crypto Tokens: Riding the News Wave and Memetic Speculation\n",
      "\n",
      "📈 In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, a fascinating trend has emerged. According to Coinbase's latest report, AI-related crypto tokens have been leaving bitcoin and ether in the dust since Q4 of 2023. Even established AI stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft are struggling to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "📰 What's fueling this surge? It seems that AI headline news is playing a significant role, creating a buzz that propels these tokens skyward. This means that even when bitcoin takes a dip, AI-focused tokens can still soar, albeit with some upside volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 To illustrate this connection, the report highlights the case of Worldcoin. When their World ID 2.0 upgrade failed to impress, it seemed like a missed opportunity. But then, founder Sam Altman stepped in with some well-timed promotion, and boom! The value of Worldcoin shot up by a staggering 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌐 The influence of Altman doesn't stop there. His brainchild, Openai, released Sora, and Worldcoin nearly tripled in value. With Openai already raking in billions annually, it's clear that the AI sector is flexing its muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "🛑 However, before diving headfirst into this exciting market, caution is advised. The Coinbase report reminds us that many demand drivers for AI tokens are still in their infancy. For now, much of the trading action is driven by what they call \"memetic speculation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "⏳ So, how long will this AI/crypto love affair last? It's hard to say. Price and utility will eventually align, but the timeline remains uncertain. One thing is certain though – as long as the crypto market stays strong and AI keeps innovating, this narrative isn't going away anytime soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 For those eager to join the AI token frenzy, the report offers a word of advice: do your homework. Investigate how these tokens can truly revolutionize the AI landscape before making any financial commitments. It's a wild ride, but with careful navigation, there are opportunities to be seized.\n",

      "\n",
      "📈 Bitwise Asset Management's CIO, Matt Hougan, is bullish on bitcoin. With the recent approval of Bitwise's bitcoin ETF and a surge in demand, he believes we're witnessing a game-changing moment for the cryptocurrency.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌊 \"We're riding a wave,\" Hougan told CNBC. Retail investors, hedge funds, and financial advisors are flocking to these ETFs, but the big players are yet to join. When they do, brace yourself for an even bigger surge.\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 The supply-demand equation is tilting heavily in favor of bitcoin. \"Almost everyone can buy it now,\" says Hougan. This newfound accessibility combined with limited supply is fueling the price discovery frenzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "📈 Bitwise's earlier prediction of $80K by 2024 seems conservative now. Hougan hints at revising it upward to $100K or even $200K. The halvening event in April will further tighten supply, adding rocket fuel to the already blazing market.\n",

      "\n",
      "📚 With over 32 million copies sold worldwide, Robert Kiyosaki, the mastermind behind \"Rich Dad Poor Dad,\" isn't one to shy away from making waves. And this time, he's got his sights set on bitcoin and its audacious mission.\n",

      "💪 In a recent social media post, Kiyosaki didn't hold back, expressing his gratitude to bitcoin for its role in taking on the mighty U.S. dollar. He sees it as a much-needed wake-up call, restoring integrity to our financial systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 But it's not just words for Kiyosaki; he's putting his money where his mouth is. Despite price fluctuations, he remains bullish on bitcoin, even predicting a staggering $100,000 value by June. For him, any dip is merely an opportunity to scoop up more.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "🔒 Why the love affair with bitcoin? Well, Kiyosaki has long been critical of traditional fiat currencies like the dollar, dubbing them \"fake money.\" Instead, he champions assets like gold and silver as \"God's money\" and sees bitcoin as the ultimate \"people's money.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "🔮 Fundstrat's Tom Lee, a seasoned equity strategist, is making waves with his bullish bitcoin forecast. In an interview with CNBC, he confidently stated that the price of BTC could soar as high as $150,000 by the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "📈Lee's optimism stems from a combination of factors. He points to the growing demand fueled by the advent of spot bitcoin ETFs, coupled with a shrinking supply due to the upcoming halving. Additionally, if monetary policy takes a more accommodating stance, it could further bolster both risk assets and bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",

      "💼 The Department of Justice's recent crackdown on wallet developers has raised eyebrows in the cryptocurrency community. Despite lacking control over user assets, these developers are now facing criminal charges for unlicensed money transmission. This shift from regulation to criminal enforcement is a cause for concern, warns Peter Van Valkenburgh from Coin Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "📜 Since 2013, it has been crystal clear that wallet developers aren't considered money transmitters by the US government. But the DOJ's new stance challenges this understanding, diverging from the definitions set by regulatory bodies like FinCEN. This sudden change in approach could have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry.\n",

      "⚖️ In the ongoing Tornado Cash case, a telling section of the DOJ's reply brief caught Van Valkenburgh's attention. Titled \"Section 1960 Does Not Require the Business to Have Control of the Funds,\" it suggests an expansion of what constitutes an \"unlicensed money transmitting business.\" This potential overreach raises concerns about due process and regulatory boundaries.\n",

      "\n",
      "📈 In a bold move, the legendary author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has once again set tongues wagging with his latest bitcoin price prediction. Taking to social media, he not only urged investors to join the crypto revolution but also revealed his own intention to acquire more BTC before April. And what's fueling this buying spree? The much-anticipated halving event.\n",
      "\n",
      "📚 With over 32 million copies sold worldwide, Kiyosaki's financial wisdom carries weight. His advice? Even if you can't afford a whole bitcoin, consider grabbing a slice of the action with fractional investments or satoshis. According to him, this move could be a stepping stone towards his staggering forecast of $100K by September 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "💰 But wait, there's more! If bitcoin isn't your cup of tea, Kiyosaki suggests exploring the allure of silver as an alternative investment. Quoting precious metals expert Andy Schectman, he highlights the dwindling supply and sees silver coins, particularly U.S. silver eagles, as a smart choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌍 The reasons behind Kiyosaki's bullishness on BTC go beyond the halving. He points out that \"smart money\" is flocking to bitcoin due to global economic concerns: mounting debt in the U.S., China's property market woes, Japan's prolonged depression, and Germany's slide into economic hardship. It's a turbulent world out there, and bitcoin seems like a beacon of hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "💸 In line with Microstrategy's Michael Saylor, who famously called fiat money \"poor,\" Kiyosaki emphasizes that it's time to ditch the \"fake money\" and embrace real assets like gold, silver, and bitcoin. With silver being the most accessible for many, he urges everyone to take action and not be left behind.\n",

The latest statistics reveal that the global real estate market was valued at $613 trillion in 2022, with projections showing it could eclipse $729 trillion by 2028. However, despite this potential, real estate remains one of the most illiquid asset classes. \n",

      "🟧 To provide some context, assets like stocks and bonds are traded on a daily basis, but a piece of property can take more than a decade before it changes hands. Of course, one of the main reasons is that property owners prefer to hold real estate as a long-term asset or because of the sentimental value attached to generational ownership.\n",

      "💵 “The amount found last year is large in euro terms, which indicates that the control works and is effective,” says Mika Siivonen, tax expert from the Finnish Tax Administration. Besides paying taxes, individuals who have not declared their income are mandated to pay a tax increase and late penalties. Failing to this may lead to criminal sanctions, the report added.\n",

      "\n",
      "💎 Josie Osborne, Minister of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, said Thursday that the province is working to address high energy consumption by crypto miners in the region. This creates very few jobs or economic opportunities, she added.\n",

      "🔼 In December 2022, the province has called for a suspension of new electricity connections for cryptocurrency mining for 18 months. That said, around 21 projects were temporarily suspended, which had requested total of 11,700 gigawatt hours of power per year.\n",

      "💬 The letter ostensibly came in response to Bankman-Fried’s lawyers arguing on Tuesday that the proposed 40-to-50-year sentence recommended by the U.S. government prosecutors was unduly severe.

      "🖥 Worldcoin has released the results of a third-party audit conducted by Trail of Bits focused on its iris-scanning Orb technology. According to a recent report, Tools for Humanity (TFH) and the Worldcoin Foundation enlisted Trail of Bits to perform a detailed audit of the Orb’s software. This audit went beyond standard security checks to assess specific privacy and functionality aspects of the Orb.\n",
      "\n",
      "🟣 The audit investigated Worldcoin’s Orb devices, focusing on how they handle and secure user data. The findings indicated that the devices do not store personal information, except for iris codes, which are encrypted and uploaded for verification purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "🟣 During the default opt-out signup process, the Orb is designed to collect only the user’s iris code, avoiding any storage or transfer of personally identifiable information (PII) other than this.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧬 The goal is to ensure no PII is written to the Orb’s persistent storage or uploaded from the device, except for the iris code. For users opting into a more data-inclusive signup flow, any PII saved on the device’s SSD is encrypted asymmetrically, making it inaccessible for decryption by the Orb itself.\n",
