      "Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has removed several cryptocurrency emojis, causing confusion and concern in the crypto community. The removal of the emojis, including Bitcoin, has led to speculation about its impact on the market. Meanwhile, the Web3 gaming industry is facing challenges with some projects failing to deliver on promises, while Nigeria's technology sector is developing the country's first artificial intelligence with the help of a local startup. JPMorgan Chase has launched an in-house AI product, and there are concerns about the impact of spot Ethereum ETFs on Bitcoin's price. Additionally, Hollywood video game performers are set to go on strike, and Google DeepMind's AI models have achieved breakthroughs in solving complex mathematics problems. Interpol has issued red notices for two Hong Kong crypto influencers wanted for theft, fraud, and money laundering. Lastly, executives at Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have followed MicroStrategy's Bitcoin playbook to revive their companies and see a surge in their share prices.\n"

      "The International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) has issued red notices for two Hong Kong crypto influencers, Wong Ching Kit and Mok Tsun Ting, who are wanted for theft, fraud, and money laundering. Wong, known as \"Coin Young Master,\" is wanted for fraud and theft in Hong Kong, while Mok is wanted for money laundering. Both individuals were involved in promoting the now-collapsed crypto exchange JPEX, which was at the center of a significant fraud case in Hong Kong. Wong has a history of legal controversies and was previously ordered to remove all videos related to JPEX from his social media. Mok was arrested in connection to the JPEX scandal but was released on bail. The exchange collapsed amid allegations of a Ponzi scheme, resulting in over 70 arrests and $206 million in losses for clients. Wong and Mok have also faced fraud charges in the past related to the sale of \"mining rigs\" for the cryptocurrency Filecoin. The investigation into JPEX began in September last year after it was identified as an unlicensed virtual asset trading platform. As of June 3, a total of 73 individuals associated with the exchange have been arrested, all of whom have been released on bail. Additionally, executives at Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have been inspired by MicroStrategy's Bitcoin playbook to revive their companies from \"zombie\" status, leading to significant increases in their share prices. Both companies have embraced Bitcoin adoption to strengthen their balance sheets and reduce exposure to currency depreciation, despite the extreme volatility that comes with it.\n"
